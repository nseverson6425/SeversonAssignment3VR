In this project, I created a VR application designed around a bowling alley. This demonstrates a
few key features when designing good VR programs, such as teleportation, grabbing, 3D spacial audio
, and controller/hand tracking. The main goal of the demo is to use teleportation and grabbing to 
set up the pins scattered around on platforms before bowling them down. You can use the coin on the 
ground near the starting point to reset the pins and ball by placing it into the blue sphere area. 
A jingling spacial audio sound will also play on each spread out pin until they are grabbed. 

Bowling Pins are made using Blender.
Meta Quest 2 controller models are from the open source Meta Quest Website.
Spacial Audio jingle is from Freesound.org.
Wood material is from the quest 2 store for free.


 
 One of the larger problems I was stuck on for quite some time was grabbing objects until I figured 
 out that I needed to make the pins and bowling ball grabbable via script.
